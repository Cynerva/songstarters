# songstarters

A tool for creating randomized, algorithmic percussion tracks.

This was designed for my own personal use, so it's a bit rough around the edges
- however, if you're feeling adventurous, feel free to have a go at it!

## Dependencies

Songstarters is written in Lua, and depends on ffmpeg as well.

On ubuntu:
```
sudo apt install lua5.2 ffmpeg
```

## Usage

For songstarters to work, you'll have to add some samples (drums, perhaps):

```
mkdir sounds
cp /path/to/kick.wav sounds
cp /path/to/snare.wav sounds
...
```

Once you have samples, you should be able to run it:
```
./run
```

This will create a `render.flac` file, and then play it to speakers as well.

The `run` script doesn't support any args, so you'll have to edit it to change
any parameters.

The output usually isn't very interesting on its own, but it can sound a lot
more interesting when you overlay multiple tracks on top of eachother. For now,
though, that's outside the scope of this project.
